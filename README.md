# Python-Neural-Nets-from-Scratch

This repo contains mostly practice for neural networks.

I will follow from the tutorial https://medium.freecodecamp.org/building-a-3-layer-neural-network-from-scratch-99239c4af5d3, then create my own framework in Python, and then complete some small tasks using what has been made.
